# Profile


# Hi, I'm Taashna J ! üëã


## üöÄ About Me
|| AI and ML enthusiast || Data science enthusiast || Cracked GATE(DA) 2k23 || Experienced content writer ||

I am a final year student pursuing a degree in AI and Data Science with a strong passion for AI, ML, DL, data science, and cloud computing. My technical skills include programming languages such as Python, C, Java, and MATLAB. Currently, I am working on a project and enhancing my knowledge of MongoDB as a non-SQL language to advance my projects further.

I have developed skills in a range of advanced topics, including AI applications, reinforcement learning, deep learning, computer vision, GANs, graph neural networks, attention mechanisms, transformers, ethical AI, and autonomous robot navigation.

In addition to my software skills, I have hands-on experience with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I am keen on expanding my knowledge in ROS and swarm robotic systems. I am also interested in becoming a prompt engineer to leverage generative AI for optimizing workflows and minimizing redundant tasks.

I would describe myself in three words: Enthusiastic, Ambitious, and Authentic. I am always eager to learn and apply new technologies to solve complex problems and drive innovation.

## Projects:

‚Ä¢Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation on 3D CT Scan using DeepLabv3+ (2024): Developed a novel kidney and tumor segmentation approach using encoder-decoder architecture, outperforming classic U-Net architecture with DeepLabv3+ in dice-coefficient and IoU on the KiTS23 dataset. Wrote a research paper on this, and got accepted at Region 10 TENSYMP conference(IEEE). Utilized technologies such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Python for image processing, implementation and evaluation.  

‚Ä¢ Sign Language Detection (2024): Developed a sign language gesture detection and classification method using VGG16 architecture, achieving 90.57% accuracy on the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset. Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics and nuances. Implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to enhance communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community.

‚Ä¢ Cyber Threat Detection (2024): Designed and implemented a robust cyber threat detection system to accurately identify malicious sites and classify attack types using machine learning ensembles such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting. Achieved 96.1% accuracy with XGBoost, 95.9% accuracy with LightGBM, and 93.6% accuracy with Gradient Boosting. Leveraged Python, scikit-learn, hyperparameter tuning, Excel, PowerBI, and Jupyter for data analysis and visualization. 

‚Ä¢ Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification for Histopathological Analysis using Deeplabv3+ (2023): Developed an advanced system for nuclei instance segmentation and classification using DeepLabv3+ for histopathological analysis, leveraging the PanNuke dataset. Achieved training accuracy of 0.890 and validation accuracy of 0.830 on the first 1000 images, with training and validation mIoU of 0.501 and 0.395, respectively. Implemented using TensorFlow and Python, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis for pathologists.

## Accomplishments:
I won 2nd place in the esteemed National level Data Science Challenge 2.0 jointly organized by IEEE SPS SCET SBC, IEEE SCET SB and SIP Club with Deeplabv3+ approach
Wrote a research paper on Kidney and Kidney tumor segmentation on 3D CT scans using Deeplabv3+ approach which got accepted in International REGION 10 Conference by IEEE, TENSYMP.
