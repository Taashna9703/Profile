# Hi, I'm Taashna J! üëã


## üöÄ About Me
I'm a pre-final year student pursuing engineering in AI and Data science, and I'm a Web developer enthusiast, Cloud computing enthusiast and I have considerable programming skills in various languages such as Python, C, Java, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, html, css and MATLAB. I am currently working on a project using Node and react. I'm also learning Mongodb as Non-SQL DB language and plan on using it to further develop my skills and projects. I'm deeply interested in Machine learning and deep learning. I also have hardware skills for handling Microcontrollers like Arduino. I'm further looking to improve my knowledge in ROS and swarm robotic systems. I also like the sound of being a prompt engineer and using generative AI to help reduce the amount of time wasted on tedious and pointless tasks. I would describe myself in 3 words as Enthusiastic, Ambitious and Authentic.
